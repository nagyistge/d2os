CloudOS is a distributed operating system for data centers.
Its development was motivated by the papers:

* Zaharia, Matei, et al. "The datacenter needs an operating system." Proceedings of the 3rd USENIX conference on Hot topics in cloud computing. USENIX Association, 2011.

* Patterson, David A. "The data center is the computer." Communications of the ACM 51.1 (2008): 105-105.

CloudOS offers a modular microkernel structure.
